# Nectar JupyterHub BinderHub

This repository contains the code required to build a customised
version of the JupterHub container for the ARDC Nectar BinderHub service.

This is essentially only the theme, but it could possibly host other
customisations in the future.

One important distinction with this repository is that this is for a
customised JupyterHub instance that is designed to be used with BinderHub
only, so this is to replace much of the JupyterHub references to become
BinderHub
